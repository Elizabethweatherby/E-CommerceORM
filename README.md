# E-CommerceORM
For this application we have the back-end of an e-commerce shopping website that uses Express.js and Sequelize and connects to MySql to allow users to create a database. Start by seeding the database and sync the models, then you are able to use the routes in Insomnia to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data.

USER STORY: AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


For this assignment I had help with some of my routes from the instructor during office hours and from my tutor.
